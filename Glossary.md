Here‚Äôs a solid starter list of glossary terms for your AI Knowledge Hub, tailored for a software engineering team exploring AI tooling like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and LLM-based workflows:

---

### üß† Core AI Concepts

* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
  A field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence.

* **Machine Learning (ML):**
  A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve without being explicitly programmed.

* **Large Language Model (LLM):**
  A machine learning model trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand and generate human-like language.

* **Transformer:**
  A deep learning model architecture used in modern LLMs (e.g., GPT, BERT) for understanding context in sequences of text.

* **Fine-Tuning:**
  The process of training a pre-trained model on a specific dataset to specialize it for a particular task.

* **Token:**
  A unit of text (word or subword) used by LLMs to process input/output. Models have token limits per request.

### üõ† AI Tools & Usage

* **Prompt Engineering:**
  The practice of crafting effective inputs (prompts) to elicit desired responses from LLMs.

* **Zero-shot Prompting:**
  Asking the model to perform a task without giving any examples.

* **Few-shot Prompting:**
  Providing examples in the prompt to guide the model's behavior or structure its output.

* **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:**
  Encouraging the model to explain reasoning steps by asking it to "think step by step."

* **Context Window:**
  The maximum number of tokens (input + output) a model can handle in a single request.

* **Hallucination (AI):**
  When an LLM generates output that is syntactically correct but factually incorrect or fabricated.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Development Terms

* **Copilot:**
  GitHub‚Äôs AI-powered code completion tool, built on OpenAI Codex, assisting developers in real-time.

* **Autocomplete vs. Copilot:**
  Traditional autocomplete suggests syntactic code snippets; Copilot generates semantically relevant code based on intent.

* **AI Pair Programming:**
  The practice of using AI tools like Copilot to assist during development, akin to having a virtual dev partner.

* **AI-Assisted Code Review:**
  Using AI tools to suggest improvements, spot bugs, or summarize pull requests.

* **Synthetic Data:**
  Artificially generated data used to train or test models when real-world data is scarce or sensitive.

---

### üîê Safety, Ethics & Governance

* **Bias (in AI):**
  Systematic errors in outputs due to skewed training data or model assumptions.

* **Explainability:**
  The ability to understand and interpret how and why an AI model made a specific decision.

* **Red Teaming (AI):**
  Testing AI systems for vulnerabilities, harmful behavior, or misuse scenarios.

* **Responsible AI:**
  The practice of developing AI in a way that is ethical, inclusive, safe, and transparent.

* **Guardrails:**
  Techniques or policies put in place to limit undesired AI behavior or output.
